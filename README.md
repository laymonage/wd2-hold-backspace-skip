# wd2-hold-backspace-skip

A mod for Watch Dogs 2 that patches the hardcoded controls so that skipping dialogue and cutscenes is done by holding the <kbd>Backspace</kbd> key, instead of pressing <kbd>Esc</kbd>. This ensures you can exit cameras and gadgets without skipping any ongoing dialogue.

To install, download [the latest release](https://github.com/laymonage/wd2-hold-backspace-skip/releases/latest), then extract the `.zip` file and copy both `patch3.dat` and `patch3.fat` to the `data_win64` folder inside the game's directory.

Note that this will disable online play, unfortunately (or fortunately?).
